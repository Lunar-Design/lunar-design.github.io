1
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.696
Good evening.
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.280
We are on our final approach
for Seattle.

3
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.033
The weather is fair.
with winds out of the east.

4
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.351
The temperature on the ground.
68 degrees.

5
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.954
On behalf of our cabin crew.
and us here on the flight deck.

6
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.793
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us tonight.

7
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.276
Life sucks
when you can't sleep.

8
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.599
Yeah. tell me about it.

9
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.119
Sometimes it's good to talk.

10
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.873
Okay.

11
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.793
This is gonna sound crazy.

12
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.515
but you ever hear about
the videotape that kills you

13
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600
after you watch it?

14
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.679
Well. I'm at this party.

15
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.113
and I meet this girl
from Seattle.

16
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.913
We totally hit it off.

17
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.870
The next day she sends me this
video that says. "Watch me."

18
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.389
So. I find a VCR.

19
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.879
watch it.

20
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.112
but the images on it...

21
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.279
The second it was over.
my phone rings.

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.517
And this girl says
I'm gonna die in seven days.

23
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.835
That was a week ago tonight.

24
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.920
Ever since.
everything's been strange.

25
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.834
All I got to do is make it
through the next five minutes.

26
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.068
As a reminder...

27
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.309
God. I'm sorry.

28
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.856
Sir! Sir.
please stay in your seat.

29
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.161
Please remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened.

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Sir!

31
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920
What was that about?

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.195
That cute guy
sitting right next to us...

33
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.918
It turns out
he's a total head case.

34
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.675
And he was telling me about a
movie that's supposed to kill you.

35
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480
What movie?

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.595
Some video.

37
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.989
A chick calls you
on the phone after you watch it

38
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.149
and says. "Seven days."

39
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.639
which was. like. right now.

40
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
Open up!

41
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.839
Did you make a copy of it?

42
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.720
Did you make
a copy of the tape?

43
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.909
No! I...

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.016
Miss.
the seat belt light is on.

45
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
Oh. Jesus.

46
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.880
What is going on with you?
It's just a story.

47
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.792
I've seen it!

48
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.952
Traffic control.
this is Flight 77.

49
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.031
We have some
signal interference.

50
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.840
If you're not interested in
buying. I'd love to take a look.

51
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.190
Sure. I mean.
who would want an old VCR?

52
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.833
Well. once upon a time. this
was a technological revolution.

53
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.548
Okay.

54
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.679
Just talking to the guy.

55
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.959
It turns out that
he got all this stuff from

56
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.311
a family whose son died
in a plane crash a couple of years back.

57
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.753
And now it's just a bunch
of outdated junk.

58
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.159
I prefer "vintage."

59
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.358
Come on. old man.

60
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.673
You still got
some life in you.

61
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.069
Hey. Skye?

62
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.314
Guess what.

63
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.519
What?

64
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.079
Had a tape in it.

65
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.191
Care to see
what's down the rabbit hole?

66
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.231
I'm gonna be late
for class.

67
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.799
But then. maybe
you can tell me about it later.

68
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880
Have fun. Professor.

69
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.630
Come on. work.

70
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.509
Hello?

71
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.516
Seven days.

72
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.239
What? Who is this?

73
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.948
Julia.

74
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.754
I keep thinking
about this story.

75
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.677
It's. like. the most romantic
story in the history of stories.

76
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.077
Well. it's not how we met.

77
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.994
No.
It's about this guy. Orpheus.

78
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.629
His girlfriend dies
and he has to literally go down into Hell

79
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.153
to rescue her.

80
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.275
How come it's always the guy
rescuing the girl?

81
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.399
Just...

82
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.797
He tracks her down.
All right? He finds her.

83
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.395
And the Devil's gonna
let her go on one condition.

84
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.672
He has to start first.
without her.

85
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.435
He has to walk away
without looking back at her.

86
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.438
- But...
- He looks back to glimpse her

87
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.750
and loses her forever.
Ninth grade.

88
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.271
- English Lit.
- Okay. You know it.

89
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.192
So. what's your point?

90
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.116
I don't know. I just...

91
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.952
I relate to the guy.

92
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.399
I mean. I can't imagine
not looking back at you.

93
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.638
Actually. you got to go.

94
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.296
Because my boyfriend's
leaving for college.

95
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.550
and I promised
I'd help him pack.

96
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.834
- No!
- Come on. get up.

97
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.599
Baby. baby.
baby. he's a loser. Come back to bed.

98
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.318
Come back to bed. now.

99
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.389
You really need all this?

100
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480
Yeah.

101
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.237
Let's go.
Come on. come on.

102
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.995
Come on. Holt!

103
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.600
Supposed to be on the road
an hour ago.

104
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.193
Just give us
a second. Dad.

105
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.033
You're doing
the right thing.

106
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.672
Your mom. she really
needs you right now.

107
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.477
I'm gonna miss your smell.

108
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.874
Really?

109
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.229
Yeah.

110
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.114
Okay.

111
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.798
I'll see you
Columbus Day weekend.

112
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.714
And tell Tommy Lombardi
that I'm on to him.

113
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.915
What do you mean?

114
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.230
He gets a job where you work
the day I leave?

115
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.195
You're crazy!

116
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.474
Don't look back!

117
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.800
9:30. Skype. tonight!

118
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.074
Where the hell
is your shirt?

119
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200
Tonight!

120
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.315
And every night!

121
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400
And every single night!

122
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.075
Unless I'm with
Tommy Lombardi!

123
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.435
You did not
just say that!

124
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.509
Oh. baby.
it's been six weeks. I can't take it.

125
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.670
Why are you so much nicer now

126
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.830
that we don't live
in the same town?

127
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.959
Sorry. what's your name again?

128
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.951
- Shut up.
- That's a weird name.

129
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.679
How are your classes?

130
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.195
Kind of uninspiring.

131
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.511
There's this
one Experimental Biology class. though.

132
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.840
The teacher's kind of a badass.

133
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.759
That sounds cool.

134
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.395
Yeah.

135
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.233
Not everything's cool. though.

136
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.709
It's still. like.
a whole week until I get to see you.

137
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.758
Well. you're seeing me now.

138
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.757
Yeah. I guess.

139
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.595
What about I start
by taking off my hairclip?

140
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.798
Oh!

141
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.956
Yeah. Uh. okay.

142
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.835
What's next?

143
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.000
"Oh. take me. take me.
I can't stand it!"

144
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.416
How did you even
get in here?

145
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.112
These idiots just
broke into my room.

146
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.233
Come on. Vision Quest.
Gabriel says you're up.

147
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.355
Let's go to the 7s.

148
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.317
- Shit. Tonight?
- Tonight.

149
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.709
Sorry. little lady.
but boyfriend's got plans tonight.

150
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.816
You know.
but we could talk.

151
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.114
I think I'm good.

152
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.520
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

153
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.720
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- He'll talk to you...

154
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.198
Yeah. sure.

155
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.756
I told you
I'd make it up to you.

156
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.394
Julia...

157
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.759
You owe me a good dream.

158
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.957
- Where is he?
- Who are you?

159
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
Where's Holt?

160
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.696
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him in days.

161
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720
Don't lie to me!

162
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.949
I'm not lying to you!

163
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.440
What are you
doing on his computer?

164
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.988
Tell him there's no hiding.
Tell the dead man he can't hide.

165
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.833
What... What are you talking
about? What's wrong with you?

166
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.113
She's coming.

167
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.918
There's no stopping her.

168
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560
Tell Holt that...

169
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.714
Please pick up the phone.

170
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.040
This is Holt.
You know what to...

171
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.616
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

172
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.360
Holt. what's going on?

173
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.436
I just had the strangest
conversation in my life

174
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.714
with that weird girl.

175
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.160
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

176
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.953
Hello?

177
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.475
Science has told us
that we are merely

178
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.509
the primal stirrings of
some carbon. some proteins.

179
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.318
We live a while. eat.

180
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.549
have sex. when we can.

181
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.476
And that's it.
then we die.

182
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.549
Lewin. there's no need
to take notes on that part.

183
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.518
But wait. hold on.

184
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.195
because no one is denying
that we have consciousness.

185
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.948
Some inner life
that's not quite accounted for here.

186
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.795
Let's remember the infamous
double-slit experiment.

187
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.555
When no one is watching.

188
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.269
the particles just pass
through both slits at the same time.

189
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.478
But with an observer.
they behave like bullets.

190
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.874
passing through
one slit or the other.

191
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.437
This is big. guys.

192
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.276
The immaterial
human consciousness

193
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.999
has reached out
and touched the material.

194
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.637
There is a calculable
transformation in the real world.

195
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.519
and solely because

196
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.277
someone was there
to watch it.

197
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.072
Which may account
for the fact

198
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.998
that I have become
significantly sweatier once I've noticed

199
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.596
the mysterious stranger watching
me from the back of the room.

200
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.511
All right. that's it.
Go get drunk.

201
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.792
Hey. I remember
you guys from...

202
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.400
- Why'd you come here?
- Come on. dude.

203
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.192
Move it along. There you go.
There you go.

204
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.749
How can I help you?

205
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.798
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

206
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.279
He's supposed to
be in your class.

207
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.276
Okay.
What's this guy's name?

208
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.793
Holt Anthony.

209
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.394
Yeah.

210
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.873
Not sure.

211
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.280
It always takes me
until Thanksgiving

212
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.356
to start putting
names to faces.

213
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.032
Really? 'Cause

214
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.594
he was supposed to do some sort
of extra credit thing for you.

215
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320
Did he?

216
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.795
Maybe. I don't know.

217
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.874
I do know that
I have 25 essays to grade.

218
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.159
Listen. Okay.

219
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.557
It's not uncommon for a new
student to find something or someone

220
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.354
that's more interesting
to them than class.

221
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.310
My advice to you?
Move on.

222
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440
Calm down.

223
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.776
I'm telling you.
it's different.

224
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.633
Everyone says that.
It's okay. Where's your tail?

225
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.438
I don't have
one anymore.

226
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.896
I told you
not to call him.

227
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.911
That asshole
hung up on me!

228
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.399
I wonder why.

229
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.675
Okay. We'll switch tails.
You talk to Holt?

230
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.878
No! I tried.
He isn't answering his phone.

231
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.632
- Come on.
- Holt has his own problems.

232
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.239
You have to help me. Gabriel.

233
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.496
It's your fault!
You started this!

234
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.635
Calm down.

235
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.229
Listen to me. Gabe!

236
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.470
The videos.
the tails. all these people.

237
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.434
- It's wrong and she's pissed!
- You're being ridiculous.

238
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.159
I can feel her.
It's all changing.

239
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.394
You don't have much time.
You need to trust me.

240
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.072
How could I
ever trust you?

241
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.176
Get to your studio.
Don't talk to anyone along the way.

242
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.713
Make a copy of
the video and wait.

243
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.872
I'm gonna send
someone right now. Hey. hey. hey!

244
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.277
Everything's gonna
be fine. darling. You understand?

245
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.794
Yes! I understand!

246
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.797
But you don't.

247
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.274
I honestly didn't find the
tape to be that scary. but...

248
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.874
Oh. Hey. you're not
supposed to be here!

249
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.149
Hey!

250
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.198
You called me
the other night.

251
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.875
Hey! Look at me.

252
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.354
You're the girlfriend.

253
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.875
Where's Holt?

254
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.638
I... I can help you.

255
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.791
But I need to show you
something first.

256
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.994
You live here?

257
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.911
Yeah. Fine Arts.
Grad program.

258
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.759
I need a clear head
to do my work. and I like my privacy.

259
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.435
Is Holt even here?

260
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.672
Did I say he would be?

261
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.080
Be careful where you step.
I just painted the ceiling.

262
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.194
Nothing's wrong.
He's not avoiding you.

263
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.831
He's just on a journey.

264
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.000
I want you to watch something
and then you'll understand.

265
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.156
- Is that my phone?
- You're lying!

266
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.755
I need you to do this for me.

267
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.751
It's just a two-minute video.
It won't hurt you.

268
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.789
Open the door!

269
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.038
Julia! I need you to help me.

270
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.233
Holt watched it.
We've all watched it.

271
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.315
Open the door!

272
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.274
You're not real.

273
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.873
You're not real!

274
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.473
7:10.

275
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.999
I win. bitch.

276
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240
Jules!

277
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.753
What happened?
What happened?

278
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.671
Tell me you didn't watch it.
Tell me!

279
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.069
She's dead.
She's dead. She's dead.

280
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.754
Hello?

281
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.596
Uh... Gabriel sent me.

282
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.398
I'm supposed to watch a video.

283
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.275
Hello.

284
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.078
Gabriel. Gabriel.

285
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.268
Do you know about Skye?

286
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.998
I know.
Someone put a picture of her online.

287
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.638
Everyone's dropping out.

288
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.234
Wait.

289
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.399
Wait.
Do I still have a tail?

290
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.115
Gabriel?

291
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.320
Is someone still
watching for me?

292
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.496
I'm gonna find you someone.
I promise you that.

293
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.873
Just stay where you are.

294
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.113
Who was that?

295
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.078
It was Gabriel.

296
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.992
Everything's gonna
be fine.

297
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.911
That's what
he told Skye.

298
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.390
Listen. Julia.

299
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.916
I'm really sorry that
you had to see that.

300
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.836
But I can't let you
get caught up in this.

301
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.911
I think it's a little
too late for that.

302
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.519
I watched it.

303
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.438
Twelve hours
after Skye.

304
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.596
We were supposed to
help each other through it.

305
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.908
"Help each other"?

306
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.915
Yeah.

307
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.797
- So were you and her...
- No.

308
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.318
Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be
chosen for this experiment.

309
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.589
If you just heard
the way he described it.

310
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.592
That we could prove
the existence of a soul.

311
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.318
Of life after death.

312
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.191
I know.
I know. It sounds crazy.

313
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.475
but I'm just...

314
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.157
The tape is the doorway
to the other side.

315
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.712
Then why did she die?

316
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.672
You have seven days
before you die.

317
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.712
You just have
to watch the tape and make a copy.

318
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.856
and show it
to someone else.

319
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.313
And then you're fine.

320
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.558
Gabriel calls it a "tail."

321
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.398
Her tail just didn't show.

322
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.796
So were you
supposed to pass on a death sentence

323
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.915
to someone else?

324
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.275
How could you get
involved in this?

325
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.560
Please.

326
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.038
Whatever you are.

327
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.875
leave him alone.

328
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.317
Seven days.

329
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.233
Jules. What did you do?

330
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.714
I saw something.

331
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.314
There was a room. A door.

332
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.115
Yeah.

333
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.673
It's Gabriel.

334
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.872
Holt. listen.
I've got a tail for you.

335
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.558
It's not for me anymore.

336
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.748
You know why I wasn't
answering your calls. right?

337
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.234
It was to
protect you from this.

338
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.830
Gabriel had a solution
for me.

339
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.831
It would have been fine.
I would have been fine.

340
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.919
Then I'll be fine. too.

341
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.635
Jules!

342
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.629
What happened?

343
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.079
A bird.

344
00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.873
There was a bird.

345
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.754
Julia!

346
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.838
See? I told you
there was a bird.

347
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.678
Julia!

348
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.799
But I saw it.

349
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.195
So you watched the tape.

350
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.993
And I had
dismissed self-sacrifice as popular myth.

351
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.832
Holt was running out
of time.

352
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.351
It was the only way
to save him.

353
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.516
Anyone would have done it.

354
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.356
You know.
I could show you some research

355
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.476
that would
suggest the opposite.

356
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.873
She's marked already.

357
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.713
On day one.

358
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.794
And it's... It's different.

359
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.075
I wasn't marked
until day five.

360
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.310
Gabriel.
this has to mean something.

361
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.350
It's happening faster.

362
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.552
Maybe it is all changing.

363
00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.549
I wanted to believe that tape
meant a lot of things.

364
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.478
That our souls are eternal.

365
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.392
and when we die.

366
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.953
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

367
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.918
Then I saw the picture.

368
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.872
I saw Skye's face.

369
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.992
You saw it. too.

370
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.708
You want to survive. you make a
copy and you show someone.

371
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.239
No one is dying
because of me.

372
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.634
I'll tell them how it works.

373
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.911
And so what?
The cycle just continues?

374
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.595
What do you think
survival is?

375
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440
Just make a copy.

376
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.750
We'll decide what
to do with it later.

377
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.908
Please.

378
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.000
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

379
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.274
What did you do here?

380
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.831
Uh. her version won't copy.

381
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.831
What do you mean
"it won't copy"?

382
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.038
Your file size is
larger than the original.

383
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.839
How can that be?

384
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.674
Scrub through her copy.

385
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.556
Ooh. what is that?
Go back.

386
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.634
Right there!

387
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
The bird.

388
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.274
I told you in the car
I saw that bird.

389
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.595
What?

390
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.034
It shouldn't be there.

391
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.193
I need my equipment.

392
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.995
Okay. See. there's these
weird gaps in the digital code.

393
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.315
Glitches where we get
these ghost images. like your bird.

394
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.234
I mean. we're talking
one or two frame still images.

395
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.390
but there's more.

396
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.711
There's video data condensed
in the still frames.

397
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.073
A video within the video?

398
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.074
Well. there is now.

399
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.316
I don't want you
to watch it.

400
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.992
Jules. there's no way.

401
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.792
We're watching this together.
End of discussion.

402
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.434
Holt. whatever it is.
I think it's intended for Julia alone.

403
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.039
Look at me.

404
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.077
I know you're upset
that I watched it.

405
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.715
But we can't let it be
for nothing.

406
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.556
So don't look back. okay?

407
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.795
Put it on.

408
00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.520
Jules?

409
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.431
Baby. tell us
what you see.

410
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.518
A clock.

411
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.117
A cross in a flood.

412
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.874
A girl.

413
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.359
Jules.

414
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.869
Jules?

415
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.714
I don't know.

416
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.713
A burning body.

417
00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.388
Jules!

418
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.350
Sorry. I. um...

419
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.079
What was it?

420
00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:46.475
Only images.
but I can't explain how it felt.

421
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.918
Flood.
Fire. Cremation.

422
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.992
Those are images
that have never been on the tape before.

423
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.637
You know.
primitive cultures believed

424
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.392
that the only way
to free a soul

425
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.033
is to burn the body.

426
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.076
That is.
if you can find it.

427
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.388
Wait.

428
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.273
I saw this.

429
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.396
That's where
they buried her.

430
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.111
I traced it to a town
called Sacrament Valley.

431
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.156
about four hours from here.

432
00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.751
That's where
we need to go.

433
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.675
Hello.

434
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.840
Ah. Thank you. Jamal.

435
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.030
The police are
on their way here.

436
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.872
And you're not
even coming with us!

437
00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.315
The police want to
ask me questions. Holt.

438
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.833
They think
you killed Skye.

439
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920
But you didn't.

440
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.230
I hope if you learn
anything from an education.

441
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.197
it's that more than
one theory can be true.

442
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.599
I didn't kill Skye.

443
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.993
And I did.

444
00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.275
But the cops don't deal
in such ambiguities.

445
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.593
My research.

446
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.717
Everything that's known
about the tape is in there.

447
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.956
It'll be more of a help to you
than I can be.

448
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.473
A man never quite
measures up to his work.

449
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.873
The images on the tape.
they were her story.

450
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.031
She wanted it to be heard.

451
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.598
"Samara was found abandoned
as a young child.

452
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.509
"No one knew where she came
from or who her parents were.

453
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.636
"She was adopted.
and they realized

454
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.520
"that something was unnatural
about this girl.

455
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.234
"Something evil.

456
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.439
"They tried to kill her.

457
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.192
"but Samara survived for seven
days at the bottom of the well.

458
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.475
"They found her body
years later."

459
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.834
And they brought her
all the way to this town?

460
00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.148
Why?

461
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.676
I don't know.

462
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440
That girl.

463
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.753
What girl?

464
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.835
Hello?

465
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.154
Hello?

466
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.195
Can I help you?

467
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.315
Hey. uh...

468
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.472
There was no light outside.
Do you have any vacancies?

469
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.235
Two rooms?

470
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680
One.

471
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.593
Cash only.
Checkout's at noon.

472
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.196
It's an old house.

473
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.679
Walls are thin.

474
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.837
Hope you don't mind the cats.

475
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.668
I'm just down the hall.

476
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.634
Excuse me.
Who's the girl in this photo?

477
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.835
The one
in the middle there?

478
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.477
Why. that's my niece.

479
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.830
Beautiful. isn't she?
People say we look just...

480
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.832
No. I'm sorry.
I meant the girl with the violin.

481
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.480
Oh. That's Evelyn.

482
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280
I think I saw her.

483
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.794
Earlier today.

484
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.112
That's not possible.

485
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.551
She disappeared 30 years ago.

486
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.471
Does anyone know why?

487
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.275
No.

488
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.195
And I'd rather
not talk about it.

489
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.471
Ma'am.
where's the church?

490
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.358
Well.
it's not a church anymore.

491
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.790
That's when
I hit rock bottom.

492
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.590
I guess the worst part of it
for me was that I let down my kids.

493
00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680
I let down my husband.

494
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.554
Raise your hand
if life ever let you down.

495
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.356
Go ahead now. raise your hand.

496
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.595
And then you found the drug
that you thought unlocked a secret.

497
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.673
One day at a time.

498
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.633
Thank you all for coming.

499
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.597
I'll see you next week.

500
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.314
Jules. We better go.

501
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.956
So. what do we do now?

502
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.629
Awful young to be here.
Don't let it kill you.

503
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.799
Excuse me. sir!

504
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.559
Could you tell me
a little bit more about the church?

505
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.959
When did it close?

506
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.479
Been 13 years.

507
00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.038
After the flood.

508
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.157
Town used to have five times
this many people.

509
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.829
Ever since.

510
00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.550
there's more dead
than alive around here.

511
00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240
Thank you.

512
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880
He said the church was...

513
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.393
That's where
they brought her.

514
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.029
The cemetery.

515
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.352
Look for her name.

516
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.800
Come on. pick up.

517
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.716
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

518
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.518
Holt. it's Gabriel.

519
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.936
I don't know if you're getting
these messages.

520
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.758
but I figured out
the mark on Julia's hand.

521
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.513
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

522
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.109
"The waters rose to carry them
and brought them back safely to God."

523
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720
Holt!

524
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.309
Holt!

525
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.357
Hey. hey. hey.

526
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.393
She's in there.

527
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.711
Someone moved her.

528
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.473
Jules?

529
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.039
What are you doing?

530
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.313
There's writing.

531
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.234
Holt.

532
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.075
Holt!

533
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.393
Julia!

534
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.016
Hey. what happened?
What happened?

535
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.439
What happened?

536
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.639
I saw something.

537
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.474
The well.

538
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.159
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

539
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.594
We were just looking...

540
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.999
I know
who you're looking for.

541
01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.148
Let's go.

542
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.071
- What did you find?
- Two kids.

543
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.518
Caught them
breaking into 294.

544
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.836
Breaking in?

545
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.399
Well. that's new.

546
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.296
You want me to
take them down to the Sheriff's Office?

547
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.436
No. no. no. no. no.
don't bother the Sheriff.

548
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.033
I can take care of this.

549
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.033
I'm Galen Burke.

550
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.837
I watch over things here.

551
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.953
So to speak.

552
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.236
Please. Come in.

553
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.519
It's not much.

554
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.029
But I wasn't
expecting company.

555
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.040
- I can... I can take...
- No. no. I'm fine. son.

556
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.552
I know every corner
of this house.

557
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.080
So.

558
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.833
you're looking
for the girl.

559
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.197
I find it interesting

560
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.999
that you managed
to find her grave

561
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.355
even after
the marker was removed.

562
01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.788
I had a vision.

563
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.672
An image of that grave
that led me here.

564
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.870
And inside the grave.

565
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.232
I saw a vision
of a well.

566
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.074
A vision.

567
01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.079
So. you want to know
about Samara Morgan.

568
01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.909
Our priest was very active
with the community back then.

569
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.629
He heard that after
all the little girl had been through

570
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.230
that she was being denied
a resting place.

571
01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.516
Well. who's to say that charity isn't
meant for the dead?

572
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.117
So why isn't she
there now?

573
01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.429
Well. because we paid
mightily for this act of charity.

574
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.868
It was as if God and nature
itself wanted us to be rid of her.

575
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.189
The flood.

576
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.349
Yes.

577
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.670
But I had
let myself believe.

578
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.719
like you.

579
01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.229
that she was trying
to tell me something.

580
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.237
I was pulled
to that grave.

581
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.549
She showed me things.

582
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.715
Things that no one
should have to imagine.

583
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.037
And then I went blind.

584
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
I'm so sorry.

585
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.513
No. don't be.

586
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.355
It brought me peace.

587
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.068
The priest requested
that her body be moved.

588
01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.310
He left Sacrament Valley.

589
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.719
She was buried in
a potter's field just north of town.

590
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.870
to be forgotten by all.

591
01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.033
I think we should
get out of here.

592
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.394
Listen to me.

593
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.233
There is nothing
about that girl

594
01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.197
that's worth
being curious about.

595
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.632
I need to see this through.

596
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.994
Why?

597
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.480
Because you think
you were chosen for something?

598
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.555
Having a vision

599
01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.313
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

600
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.153
Thank you.

601
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.392
What's this on your hand?

602
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.920
Why did you put this mark
on your hand?

603
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.799
What do you mean?

604
01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.829
Be careful.

605
01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.949
You hear me?

606
01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.388
So. what now?

607
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.754
We gotta find the body.

608
01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.595
What?

609
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.159
Hey. stay right there.

610
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.590
This road's closed.
There's been an accident.

611
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.637
- Need you to turn it around.
- Okay. sir.

612
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.279
- Julia!
- It's that girl.

613
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.674
From the picture.

614
01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.080
Hey! Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Where do you think you're going. sir?

615
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.551
Excuse me. Turn around.

616
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.595
Stop!

617
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.309
Evelyn!

618
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.229
Stop!

619
01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.029
Gabriel?

620
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
Oh. Gabriel.

621
01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.029
Over here!

622
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.360
- He needs help!
- Hey!

623
01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Gabriel.

624
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.115
What is it?

625
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.674
Hey. sir! Please!

626
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.197
Gabriel. tell me.

627
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.719
You can't be down there!

628
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.400
Julia!

629
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.874
He was coming
for a reason.

630
01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.151
He wanted to
tell us something.

631
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.836
No. she wanted to
tell us something.

632
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.635
This girl has something
to do with Samara.

633
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.439
We need to go back.

634
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.396
I can feel her pain.
her suffering.

635
01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.760
I'm sick with it
and it's getting worse.

636
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.758
I'm so tired.

637
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.193
Then you sleep.

638
01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.436
I'm gonna get us
something to eat.

639
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.669
Okay.

640
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.189
Look.

641
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.117
We'll figure this out.

642
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.679
I was right there.

643
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.668
There you go.
Karen.

644
01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.672
Chicken fried
steak and coffee.

645
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.909
Hey. Menu?

646
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.513
Yeah. Sure.

647
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.910
So. what is that?
Chicken or steak?

648
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.079
You're funny.

649
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.439
Look. I...

650
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.598
I don't mean to
be rude. but. uh...

651
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.553
The girl who's friends with your
niece. the one who disappeared...

652
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.512
Can you tell me
a little bit more about what happened?

653
01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.310
My niece and she

654
01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.834
knew each other through
the church music program.

655
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.910
But she was the most gifted.

656
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.473
People used to kid her.
"You're too good for this place.

657
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.438
"We're gonna wake up one day
and you'll be gone. and that'll be that."

658
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.115
I guess there's certain jokes
you shouldn't make

659
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.599
because it happened.

660
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.838
She disappeared.

661
01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.593
No clothes gone. No note.

662
01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.240
Just vanished.

663
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.040
Ah!

664
01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.915
The priest.

665
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.878
He kept you down here.

666
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.319
The child!

667
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.356
Thirty-four weeks.

668
01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.631
Eight and a half months.

669
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.198
You were pregnant.

670
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.557
You were Samara's mother.

671
01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.275
The police investigated
for six months.

672
01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.119
and then we stopped
hearing from them.

673
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.953
Town never felt
quite the same after that.

674
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.879
The priest.

675
01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.680
Do you know
what happened to him?

676
01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.433
He still lives in town.

677
01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.959
Although he isn't
a priest anymore.

678
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.712
Not since
he went blind.

679
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.950
I have to go.
Uh. excuse me.

680
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.909
Mr. Burke!

681
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.634
It's Julia!
I have to talk to you!

682
01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.072
The boy's not with you.

683
01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.909
What's wrong?

684
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.395
I think I understand
my visions.

685
01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.509
The things
she's been showing me.

686
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.316
I need to know
about the priest.

687
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.794
I guess. just like
most people in the town.

688
01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.914
the event sort of
took it out of him.

689
01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.477
I just don't see
why it matters.

690
01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.356
There was a girl
here 30 years ago who disappeared.

691
01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.233
I've seen her.

692
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.828
Evelyn Borden.

693
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.713
You knew her?

694
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.639
Everyone knew Evelyn.

695
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.430
She was kept
under the church.

696
01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.432
I found a room.
It was like a prison.

697
01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.029
There were days
marked off on the walls.

698
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.394
Nine months.

699
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.198
She's Samara's mother.

700
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.753
She suffered from
the day she was born.

701
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.795
And she's still
suffering now.

702
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.518
I think I understand it.

703
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.798
This curse. This.

704
01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.510
It will never stop
until she's free.

705
01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.993
What's that sound?

706
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.913
Cicadas.

707
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.709
Burke.

708
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.473
Jules?

709
01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.789
Jules!

710
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.469
Julia...

711
01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.795
I know what it's like
to be guided by visions.

712
01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.995
To be certain.

713
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.753
I was certain
that I would father

714
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.150
a child that
was gonna change the world.

715
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.993
And I was right.

716
01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.671
You see. Julia.

717
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.191
she didn't take my sight.

718
01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.589
I did.

719
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.679
Good girl.

720
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.194
You're very brave.

721
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.396
You're Samara's father.

722
01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.671
You kidnapped Evelyn.

723
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.269
The night that
I laid with her.

724
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.952
I heard them.

725
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280
The cicadas.

726
01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.960
You moved her bones
and she's still your prisoner.

727
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.918
As are you.

728
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.799
Ah!

729
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.554
You think that
you're the first Good Samaritan

730
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.200
that she cried
out to. to free her?

731
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.510
You're the 12th. Julia.

732
01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.320
Though none of
the others got this far.

733
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.995
You think that
you're so close to bringing her peace.

734
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.392
But you have no idea the hell that you
would unleash on the world.

735
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.959
Julia?

736
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.873
Samara can't hurt me.
because I can't see her.

737
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.599
But you. Julia.

738
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.153
I can hear your every breath!

739
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.915
You will

740
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.839
not set her free!

741
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.348
Julia.

742
01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.757
you remind me of Evelyn.

743
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.278
I chained Evelyn's hands

744
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.989
because she was
trying to kill our child.

745
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.912
I should have let her!

746
01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.673
She was your daughter!

747
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.712
What are you
trying to show me?

748
01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920
No.

749
01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.633
Samara.

750
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.478
You're here.

751
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240
Julia?

752
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.595
Here she is. Samara!

753
01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.037
This is what
becomes of your savior!

754
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.391
With the grace of
the Holy Spirit.

755
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.353
may the Lord who
freed you from sin

756
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.508
save you.

757
01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.195
and raise you up!

758
01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.072
Julia...

759
01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.959
Don't leave me.

760
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.592
...from sin!

761
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.835
May the Lord save you!

762
01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.754
Through this holy anointing...

763
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.748
Who's there?

764
01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.755
Samara.

765
01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.517
Hey. It's okay.

766
01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.679
It's over.

767
01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.508
It's over.

768
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.154
Not yet.

769
01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.151
What could that
have felt like?

770
01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.873
To be feared by everyone
who's supposed to love you.

771
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.552
Not everyone.

772
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.031
You were never
afraid of her.

773
01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.916
You're free. Samara.

774
01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.456
Holt. It's Gabriel.

775
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.816
I don't know if you're getting
these messages.

776
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.559
but I figured out the mark
on Julia's hand.

777
01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.676
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

778
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.117
Our souls
are eternal.

779
01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.271
and when we die.

780
01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.874
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

781
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.748
I'm telling you.
she's coming back.

782
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.193
This time for real.

783
01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.750
You were never
afraid of her.

784
01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.839
Just because
you had a vision

785
01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.600
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

786
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.834
You have no idea

787
01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.310
the hell that you would
unleash on the world.

788
01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.793
And I'm sorry.

789
01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.111
It won't stop.

790
01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800
No. no.

791
01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.916
What?

792
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.119
No. no. no!

793
01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.829
Stop!

794
01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.118
Come on!

795
01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.199
Julia!
