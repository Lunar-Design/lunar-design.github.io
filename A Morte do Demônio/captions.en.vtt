00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:24.366
(STAMMERS) The instruments
took a lot of damage.

336
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:26.007
UPWORTH: Been happening
every 46 seconds...

337
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.908
ever since we got here.

To the place I belong...

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:51.765

(CHUCKLES)
That's fuckin' John Denver.

345
00:23:57.354 --> 00:23:58.897
That's Take Me Home.

be kidding.

347
00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:02.192
TENNESSEE: Oh. no. I never
kid about John Denver.

348
00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:05.112
There's geometric data. too.

349
00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:08.782
Mother. please track
the signal to its source.

350
00:24:09.199 --> 00:24:10.534
MOTHER: Working.

351
00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:16.873
Source of transmission located.

352
00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:22.045
Signal originates in Sector 87.

353
00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:25.382
Right ascension 47.6.

354
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:30.387
And a declension of 24.3
from our current location.

355
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:37.018
She appears to be
a main sequence star.

356
00:24:37.102 --> 00:24:38.436
a lot like our own.

357
00:24:39.062 --> 00:24:41.064
But old. very old.

358

Five planets.

359
00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:45.235
Wait. Look at that.

360
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.156
Planet number four.

361
00:24:50.073 --> 00:24:52.993
Planet number four is square
in the habitable zone.

362
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.579
Prime candidate. in fact.

363
00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:59.749
0.96 G's at surface.
Oceans. land mass.

364
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:03.503
High likelihood of
a living biosphere.

365
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.046
It's beyond your most optimistic

366
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.840
projections for ORIGAE-6.

367
00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:09.759
How did we miss this?
We scanned the entire sector.

368
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:12.095
Ricks. how far is it?

369
00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:13.513
RICKS: She's close.

370
00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:16.141
A little jump.
Few weeks.

371
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:18.810
Wouldn't even have to
go back into hypersleep.

372
00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:25.609
ORAM: And how long
is it going to take

373
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:27.152
to get to ORIGAE-6?

374
00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:29.112
Seven years. four months.

375
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:32.199
FARIS: (SIGHS) That's one
hell of a sleep cycle.

376
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:34.701
Sir.

377
00:25:34.784 --> 00:25:36.804
I think it's safe to say that
none of us are too keen...

378
00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:38.788
on getting back into
one of those pods.

379
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:45.629
Maybe we need to. um.
take a closer look.

380
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.964
Hmm?

381
00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:50.175
Any objections?

382
00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:54.554
Okay. Ricks.

383
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.807
Let's. uh. chart a course.
and take a closer look.

384
00:25:58.391 --> 00:25:59.476
RICKS: Yes. sir.

385
00:26:00.644 --> 00:26:02.646
Captain. can I talk
to you for a second?

386
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.110
Are you sure about this?

387
00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:10.946
How do you mean?

388
00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:14.824
We've spent a decade
searching for ORIGAE-6.

389
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.910
We vetted it.
ran the simulations.

390
00:26:16.993 --> 00:26:18.203
and mapped the terrain.

391
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.090
It's what we trained for.
I understand that.

392
00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.957
And now we're gonna
scrap all that...

393
00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:23.959
to chase a rogue transmission?

394
00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:26.336
Think about it.

395
00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:27.504
A human being out there.

396
00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:28.909
where there can't be any humans.

397
00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:31.341
A hidden planet that turns
up out of nowhere...

398
00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:33.635
and just happens
to be perfect for us.

399
00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:35.136
It's too good to be true.

400
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.347
Too good to be true?
What do you mean by that?

401
00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:39.074
We don't know
what the fuck's out there.

402
00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:41.184
Maybe we just missed
the planet. Danny.

403
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:44.020
This is a monumental risk
not worth taking.

404
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:45.855
I'm not committing to anything.

405
00:26:46.022 --> 00:26:47.458
I'm simply trying
to navigate the path

406
00:26:47.482 --> 00:26:49.025
as it unfolds before us.

407
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:50.336
And this has the potential...

408
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.071
to be a better habitat
for our colony.

409
00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.548
It has the potential.
We don't know that.

410
00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.157
By the way. this crew...

411
00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.827
nobody wants to
get back in the pods.

412
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:00.370
Right?

413
00:27:01.413 --> 00:27:03.748
And that was a human voice
in that transmission.

414
00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:06.418
And it's our responsibility
to investigate...

415
00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:08.336
It's our responsibility
to protect

416
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.714
the 2.000 colonists
on this ship.

417
00:27:12.382 --> 00:27:13.383
Hey.

418
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.887
I'm not
free-climbing here.

419
00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:21.599
I need ropes.
And I'm using ropes.

420
00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:23.643
This is good judgment.

421
00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:27.230
based on all the data available.

422
00:27:27.397 --> 00:27:28.565
Do you understand?

423
00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:30.483
As your second.
I need to protest.

424
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:32.027
Officially.

425
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:34.779
Officially?

426
00:27:38.867 --> 00:27:41.411
Okay. Danny.
I'll put it in the log.

427
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:44.748
You're dismissed.

428
00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:12.877
RICKS: I'm cycling
through every channel...

429
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:14.861
but getting a lot of
interference and white noise.

430
00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:16.488
Some high frequency echoes.

431
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.947
You hear anything?

432
00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:20.658
Just the continuing signal
from our friendly ghost.

433
00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:22.994
Let's bring us into close orbit.

434
00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:25.997
And prepare the Lander.

435
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:27.999
MOTHER: Roll in progress.

436
00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:30.627

437
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:46.518
RICKS: Tox levels
within tolerances.

438
00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:48.978
That's one hell
of a strong ionosphere.

439
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:50.425
FARIS: (ON RADIO)
Yeah. I see it.

440
00:28:50.814 --> 00:28:52.690
Hey. you ever done
a Lander drop before?

441
00:28:52.857 --> 00:28:53.983

like a plasma storm

is in the thermosphere.

444
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:58.780
We got something like 250 KPH.

445
00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:00.667
It's gonna be a motherfucker
to fly through.

446
00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:03.118
UPWORTH: Yeah.
I'm afraid so.

447
00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:04.470
Communications will be
spotty if the storm

448
00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:05.829
goes electromagnetic.

449
00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:07.455
ORAM: Gonna be
safe to land?

450
00:29:07.622 --> 00:29:09.124
Depends on what you call safe.

451

Expect to hit exosphere in five.

480

Might want to hold on
back there.

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:21.369
how much closer
can we get to the planet?

988
01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:23.997
MOTHER: Anything closer
than 80 kilometers

989
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.207
to the perimeter
of the storm system...

990
01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:29.752
will likely exceed
safety tolerances.

991
01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:31.587
Mother. bring us
to 80 kilometers

992
01:00:31.713 --> 01:00:32.839
above the storm.

993
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:34.882
Hold on.
Just wait a minute.

994
01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:36.509
The closer we get
to the planet...

995
01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:38.720
the better chance we have
to communicate with them.

996

999
01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:44.434
We can't evacuate them.

1000
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.703
So if they're in trouble.
they have

1001
01:00:45.727 --> 01:00:46.870
to figure it out for themselves.

1002
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.438
I'm sorry. but that's the truth.

1003

And you need to get back
to your station.

1009

Did you say the Cargo Lift?

1212

to keep busy. I suppose.

took so many forms...
