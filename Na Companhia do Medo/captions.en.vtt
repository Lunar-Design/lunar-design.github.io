1
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000

2
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:06.398
He came back again last night
and tore me like paper.

3
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:11.195
He opened me like a flower of pain...

4
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.990
...and it felt good.

5
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.495
He sank into me and set me on fire...

6
00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.873
...like he always does.

7
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:27.211
Made me burn from the inside out.

8
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.173
How did you know it was the devil?

9
00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.928
I know what you're thinking.

10
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.057
I know you think
I'm talking about my stepfather...

11
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.684
...because you don't believe
in the devil.

12
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.313
Okay. let's talk about your stepfather.

13
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:52.069
You know about my stepfather.
You know I cut his throat.

14
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:56.240
I cut his Adam's apple in half...

15
00:01:56.407 --> 00:02:00.494
...like a piece of fruit
on a summer day...

16
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.580
...so he wouldn't say a word.

17
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:08.127
I sat next to him
and watched him die...

18
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.505
...slowly.

19
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.053
It was the only way to help him stop.

20
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.305
Stop what?

21
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.560
Stop fucking me!

22
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.439
You're not listening.

23
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.777
I am listening. Chloe.

24
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:39.116
You're not listening with your heart.
Just your brain.

25
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.452
Your brain is the problem.

26
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:48.625
You have no idea
how it feels not to be trusted.

27
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:52.045
You've got to trust me too. Chloe.

28
00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:58.051
You can't trust someone
who thinks you're crazy.

29
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.851
Okay. I think that's enough for today.

30
00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:11.565
But I do think we made
some really good headway...

31
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.567
...found out some new things--

32
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.362
Do you know what it is
to burn from the inside?

33
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.407
-Do you know? Because you are dead!
-Let her go. Chloe.

34
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:25.120
I am. I'm not touching her!
I'm not touching her! Let me go!

35
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.664
Let me go! Let me go.

36
00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.551
Thank you.

37
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:48.685
You're driving me crazy! Stop!

38
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.395
-Stop it!
-Let go!

39
00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.481
Stop it!

40
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.152
I can walk by myself!

41
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.863
Stand up!

42
00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.699
Look at that.

43
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.118
"I'm a doctor."

44
00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:09.414
"Open this door."
Hey. you are dead!

45
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.333
Get in.

46
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.086
She's nuts.

47
00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:15.105
Hey.

48
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.815
Sorry.

49
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.192
I need to cross-reference some files
with you on Monday.

50
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.236
How's your morning?

51
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.574
-Check with Anna. She'll fit you in.
-Thanks. Sorry.

52
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.540
I'm not discharging her. period.

53
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:38.295
If you want to pursue this. sir.
have a judge order her transfer.

54
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.048
Until then she's mine.

55
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.216
Thank you.

56
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:44.634
Lawyers.

57
00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:48.221
Hey. come on in.

58
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.640
What's up?

59
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:53.268
Chloe. She's embellishing
her rape story again.

60
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:57.314
She says that the devil
is visiting her in her cell.

61
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.484
-Okay.
-It's the third time in three months.

62
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.945
It has something to do with
her stepfather. possibly remorse...

63
00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:07.157
...but instead of assessing
the memory and accepting it...

64
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:13.121
...she just falls into these
satanic meanderings.

65
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.332
Time. Give it time.

66
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.836
I've given it time. Time and Elavil.
And Mellaril and Haldol.

67
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.964
Maybe they're just...

68
00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:24.674
...too medicated.

69
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.012
I know we all create our realities
to some extent. Yes. true.

70
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.600
But what she creates
is so far from any objective reality....

71
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.187
Chloe's mind only runs on one track.

72
00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:41.149
Well. right now.
my mind is running on empty.

73
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.321
Come here.

74
00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:55.247
You have a brilliant mind.

75
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.208
You'll figure it out.

76
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.921
Throw it on the mirror.

77
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.553
This is what she sees now.

78
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.933
-A distorted image of herself.
-Who are you in all this?

79
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:18.186
-I'm the mirror.
-You are the mirror.

80
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:23.316
If I'm the mirror and she's the image...

81
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.612
...then who are you?

82
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.490
I can see both of you...

83
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.118
...so I'm God.

84
00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:36.913
Or just an overworked
hospital bureaucrat.

85
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.374
"God" is good.

86
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:46.715
Always remember.
the ability to repress...

87
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:51.970
...is actually a vital survival tool.
Without it...

88
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.432
...Chloe might not have survived.

89
00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:07.736
Sorry. am I interrupting
the happy couple?

90
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:14.618
Dr. Graham. We were just discussing
repression as a survival mechanism.

91
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.412
Oh. yeah. I had a date last week.

92
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.915
I barely survived it.
I'm trying to forget it.

93
00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.877
I'm sure your amorous adventures
are fascinating. doctor...

94
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.214
...but sadly. I'm on my way out.

95
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.634
-Well. don't let me-- I'll just--
-No. no. no. I'm leaving.

96
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.137
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek.
Meet the new contractor.

97
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.599
I'll be here. See you at dinner.

98
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.645
Keep an eye on my wife for me. Pete.
I know you will. Here.

99
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:46.441
-No. thanks.
-No. let me circumcise it for you.

100
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.694
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh.

101
00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:55.659
-Good night. boss.
-Good night. kids.

102
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.124
Why don't we share one of those
golden-crust. cheese-filled specials.

103
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:06.419
-It sounds like a great offer...
-Here's the file.

104
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.922
-...but I got work to do.
-I'm buying.

105
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.800
-It's cold when it gets here.
-We could warm it up.

106
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.969
-I hate pizza.
-Who doesn't like pizza?

107
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:16.096
Come on. you gotta eat.

108
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.348
Not with you.

109
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.728
Come on. we're supposed to celebrate.
I just got circumcised....

110
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:32.237
-Who's inside?
-We have Shelley for observation.

111
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.865
-Why? What happened?
-She had another attack.

112
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:40.203
-What'd you do. up her meds?
-Yeah. 25 milligrams.

113
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.540
That's extreme.
That dose is way too high.

114
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.334
I want a copy of that on my desk
by Monday. okay?

115
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:49.212
-Okay.
-Thank you.

116
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.752
Damn generator.

117
00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.296
Not again.

118
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.008
Irene. is that you?

119
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.511
This electric system's
gonna give us trouble.

120
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:41.181
Fourth time this week.
I'm going for my swim.

121
00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:45.268
Well. I'm gonna do my job.
as long as these damn lights stay on.

122
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.556
-Good night. Joe.
-Hey. how many laps. doc?

123
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.142
Fifty-five. but who's counting?

124
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.271
Oh. you've outdone yourself.
Hey. safe drive home.

125
00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:34.859
-Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me.
-Will do.

126
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.007
All that education
but you can't remember an umbrella.

127
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.678
-Did you get my note?
-I got your note. Your business note.

128
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.140
Right. So how was your date with...?

129
00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:11.062
With what's-her-name? It was like all of
my dates. It was brief. It was pointless.

130
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.607
She didn't respond to my sense
of humour. my boyish good looks...

131
00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:16.651
...so I started talking about work.

132
00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:20.238
She said that was not
a suitable topic for a first date...

133
00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:23.825
...and that was it.
I mean. it was just drinks. you know.

134
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.202
I mean. we didn't even have dinner.

135
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.872
She's not right.
When you know. you know.

136
00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:31.040
I know.

137
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.170
-I'll follow you down the hill.
-You don't have to.

138
00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:40.341
-I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
-Since when did you listen to the boss?

139
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:31.059
Severe showers all over northern
Connecticut and New Hampshire.

140
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.312
-I know. I see that.
--rain in Lennox County....

141
00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:45.073
--flooding throughout
Lennox County and closure....

142
00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:55.416
-I can't let you through. Road's closed.
-What's going on?

143
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:57.460
-I got this.
-There's a sinkhole.

144
00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.338
-Hi. Bob.
-You picked a hell of a night for a drive.

145
00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:04.384
There's a sinkhole up here.
you can't get through. Sorry.

146
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.971
-What should I do?
-Go a quarter of a mile. take a left--

147
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:10.473
You know that bridge
that Doug and I fish at?

148
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.976
-Yeah. the little white one?
-That's the one.

149
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:14.811
-Yeah.
-You can go across there.

150
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.564
-Okay. thanks.
-Hey. tell Doug to give me a call.

151
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:19.732
Will do.

152
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.498
-Doug. you're home?
-Yeah. where are you?

153
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:40.461
I got detoured. so I'll be home in a few
minutes. okay? How was Willow Creek?

154
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:43.339
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big mess.

155
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.092
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

156
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.429
Doug.

157
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:52.432
Doug!

158
00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:30.553
Are you okay?

159
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.557
Hey!

160
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.948
Oh. my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.

161
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:54.911
I'm a doctor. I'm gonna take you
to the hospital. I'm a doctor. honey.

162
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.706
I'm gonna help you. okay?
You're gonna be okay.

163
00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:01.042
I'm gonna help you. okay?

164
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.617
Help me!

165
00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:37.036
Somebody!

166
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.004
Dr. Graham!

167
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:49.132
You better tell me
why I'm in here. Irene.

168
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.843
She got up wild.

169
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.972
-Bring your ass back in here.
-Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan.

170
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.725
-Get your hands off me.
-Stay in the cell.

171
00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:00.643
-Keep her off.
-Restrain her.

172
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:05.565
Keep her off of me. Get off of me.
Do you hear me? Get off of me.

173
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.859
Hold on. Calm--

174
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.779
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

175
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.242
Thank you. nurse.

176
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.413
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. she calmed down.

177
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.124
This is so sad.

178
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.712
Miranda. this is very awkward.

179
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.132
I suppose that technically
I shouldn't even be treating you...

180
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.926
...but I managed to get the court
to grant us a waiver...

181
00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:35.511
...until you're transferred.

182
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.139
Anything we discuss
is in strict confidence...

183
00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.391
...and won't go anywhere but this room.

184
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.188
How long have I been in here?

185
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:49.192
Three days.

186
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.444
Why? Why?

187
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:55.907
You were admitted to our neurosurgical
unit. you were seizing violently.

188
00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.036
We did scans and they revealed
left-sided weakness. numbness...

189
00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.455
...severe frontal-lobe deficits.

190
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:05.333
You received Haloperidol.
Ativan injections.

191
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:09.045
When you came out of it. we tested.
You were negative for PCP.

192
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:14.133
You were put in restraints for a day and
a half so you wouldn't injure yourself.

193
00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:19.097
And then you basically
went into a state of catatonia.

194
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:22.558
This is the first time
I've seen you lucid.

195
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:27.271
I wanna talk to my husband.

196
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.399
Where is he? Where is he?

197
00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:33.861
You know. you're the most
logical person I know. bar none.

198
00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:37.990
You rely only on the facts.

199
00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.744
So why am I telling you this?

200
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.040
You're establishing my personality.

201
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:50.294
You think I'm a rational person. You
don't think I'm impulsive or emotional.

202
00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:54.090
And following this pattern of analysis.
we are about to discuss...

203
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:58.678
...a traumatic event which has rendered
this psychological profile useless.

204
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:03.057
-You think I'm in denial.
-Don't analyse yourself...

205
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.935
...just focus on remembering.

206
00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.273
Miranda...

207
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.443
...what's the last thing you remember?

208
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.661
I remember Chloe.

209
00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:27.665
I was having my Friday night
session with Chloe.

210
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.500
How did that go?

211
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:35.381
She was embellishing her rape story.

212
00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:38.301
-I saw Doug.
-Dr. Graham.

213
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.928
You were there.

214
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.144
When I went back to my office.
I worked on Chloe's file.

215
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:52.899
I decided to call it quits. I went down
to the pool. had a swim. 55 laps...

216
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:57.820
...saw Joe. got my keys.
Went to my car. You walked me to it.

217
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.741
-Yes.
-But--

218
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.243
-There was a detour.
-Oh. hey. tell Doug....

219
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.789
I had to go over the bridge.
so I went over the bridge.

220
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.801
I wonder what else happened.
Try to remember.

221
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.556
I got home.

222
00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:33.064
I saw Doug. He was on the couch.

223
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.989
Try to remember.

224
00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:50.831
There was a girl.

225
00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:54.377
-Yeah. there was a girl.
-No. there was no--

226
00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:57.046
Yeah. there was a girl.

227
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.465
-A girl at the bridge.
-There was no report--

228
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.884
-There was some kind of accident.
-No.

229
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:05.638
-The girl was bloody. On the bridge....
-I want to ask you about Doug.

230
00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:07.932
What's the last thing you remember?

231
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.560
Why are you asking about Doug?
I'm telling you about a girl I saw.

232
00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:13.813
Was there any trouble
in your marriage?

233
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.899
No. there was no trouble
in my marriage.

234
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:19.902
And why are you using
the past tense of the word?

235
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.696
Miranda...

236
00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:26.367
...you don't remember anything
about Doug? Anything at all?

237
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.703
Don't tell me something's
wrong with Doug.

238
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.747
I have to tell you something.
Something very difficult.

239
00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:33.582
No. no. no....

240
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:38.337
-Don't tell me something's with Doug.
-Miranda...

241
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.632
...Doug is dead.

242
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:45.177
You killed him.

243
00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:50.016
-No! No! No!
-Orderly!

244
00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:52.727
I didn't.

245
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:55.855
-No. I didn't.
-Orderly!

246
00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:59.775
I didn't! I didn't do it! No!

247
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:05.197
No! No! No. don't do it!

248
00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:09.285
-It's okay.
-I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

249
00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:13.706
I'm on your side.

250
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:05.174
One little bit more.

251
00:23:12.265 --> 00:23:14.934
Rita. Let go.

252
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:17.686
It's Dr. Grey.

253
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:25.820
Look it up. Don't look at me like that.

254
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:35.621
I'm the official champion again.

255
00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:45.131
Hello. Miranda. Welcome.

256
00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:49.969
You're one of us now.

257
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:54.223
You know I don't belong here. Chloe.

258
00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:57.560
If you're here.
it must mean that you belong.

259
00:23:57.727 --> 00:24:00.354
You are not a doctor in here.

260
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:03.774
And even if you tell the truth...

261
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.819
...no one will listen.

262
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:10.197
You know why? Because you're crazy.

263
00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:17.830
And the more you try
to prove them wrong...

264
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:21.250
...the crazier you appear.

265
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.587
You are invisible now.

266
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.881
Can you feel it?

267
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.185
Don't touch me.

268
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.562
Are you scared?

269
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:43.689
No.

270
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.983
You should be.

271
00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:14.715
I'm dreaming.

272
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:18.719
Dream logic. primary process.
that's what this is.

273
00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:20.763
I'm dreaming.

274
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:25.184
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming.

275
00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:28.354
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

276
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:32.274
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming.

277
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.281
Rise and shine. honey. It's a new day.

278
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.704
I wanna talk to Pete.

279
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:50.334
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time.
but I want you to have some breakfast.

280
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:57.049
-Why are you doing this to me. Irene?
-I'm just doing my job.

281
00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.428
You don't want me to get Jim
to help me. now do you?

282
00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:18.904
Good girl. You're doing good.

283
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:22.491
Come on. sweetheart.
now it's time for a shower.

284
00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:39.133
Come on. honey.
time to wash away your sins.

285
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.067
You're a nut.

286
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:45.449
Yeah. it's you. You.

287
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:13.602
Get away. Get away.

288
00:30:20.026 --> 00:30:23.821
What's your problem?

289
00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:56.353
I looked away for a second.
It's unacceptable.

290
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.146
It's not your fault.

291
00:30:58.314 --> 00:31:02.776
Patients always find a way to hurt
themselves. if that's what they want.

292
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:06.029
I never pegged her for a cutter.
that's all.

293
00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.031
Neither did I.

294
00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.742
Shelley says Chloe's
been threatening Miranda...

295
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.037
...so I put her in isolation for the day.

296
00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.664
How is she?

297
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.666
She's a mess.

298
00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:22.004
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly.
I've never seen that before.

299
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:25.465
She cut herself 35 times.
a lot of blood. but it's superficial.

300
00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:28.176
-What was the implement?
-Probably a scalpel...

301
00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:31.221
...though how anybody
got it in there. I have no idea.

302
00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:43.025
Hey. Tony. We're fine.

303
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:00.459
Come on.

304
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:03.879
You think I did this
to myself. don't you?

305
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.801
Did you?

306
00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.807
No.

307
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.727
Well. I don't know.

308
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:21.647
Who would it be. then? Would it be...

309
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:24.483
...Chloe. or...?

310
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:28.111
I don't know.

311
00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:33.283
By your own admission
you have difficulty...

312
00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:38.747
...distinguishing what's reality
from fantasy. so is it possible?

313
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:43.085
Yeah. as a doctor.
I understand why you think that.

314
00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:47.464
But something
is really happening to me.

315
00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:54.054
What about this moment. right now?

316
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:57.891
What about it?

317
00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.268
Is this a hallucination?

318
00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:03.563
Is it?

319
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:13.281
I suggest that we simply
increase the medication...

320
00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:15.117
...until things make sense.

321
00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:18.453
Or maybe until I can get myself
a new doctor.

322
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:20.455
Pardon?

323
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:24.292
Since I'm hallucinating
and I can't seem to remember things...

324
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.420
...you can help me with something.

325
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:28.672
Yeah. Inhale.

326
00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:31.675
Did we have an affair?

327
00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:42.144
No.

328
00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:45.355
Did you want to?

329
00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.443
Yes.

330
00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:53.071
Did you think I wanted to?

331
00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:56.158
Yes.

332
00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:59.661
Then why didn't we?

333
00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:05.500
Because you were married to the boss.

334
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.383
But I'm not now.

335
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.180
I'm here-- I'm....

336
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:21.600
I'm trying to help you.

337
00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:24.853
Why don't you trust me?

338
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:30.859
Because you can't trust somebody
when they think you're crazy.

339
00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.387
Phil.

340
00:34:59.555 --> 00:35:01.723
Hello. Miranda.

341
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:04.476
I need to talk to you for a minute.

342
00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:07.312
This is about Pete.

343
00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.319
What about him. Miranda?

344
00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:17.614
I don't think he's the best doctor
to be treating me.

345
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.284
Is your complaint about him
on a personal level?

346
00:35:23.412 --> 00:35:26.915
Pete's the best doctor
I have on my staff now.

347
00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:29.543
And he has my full support.

348
00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:32.212
Now. if you'll excuse me. Miranda.

349
00:35:59.198 --> 00:36:01.658
-Miranda.
-Hi. Teddy.

350
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:10.000
-How are they treating you?
-Like I'm crazy. Teddy.

351
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.545
-They think I did it. but I didn't do it.
-All right. Thank you.

352
00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:17.215
-I didn't do it. Teddy.
-Have a seat.

353
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:21.303
Let's not....

354
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.723
Let's not talk about what you did
or didn't do. all right?

355
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:28.643
What's important is what
I can do for you now.

356
00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:34.649
Now. the DA is pushing for a hearing
as early as next week.

357
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:39.487
Next week? We haven't even
had time to investigate.

358
00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:41.448
We can't have a hearing next week.

359
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:46.828
As your attorney. I gotta tell you
the evidence is overwhelming.

360
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:50.665
You've been placed at the scene.
The sheriff saw you driving home.

361
00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:52.667
The neighbours heard the screams.

362
00:36:52.835 --> 00:36:55.670
They've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

363
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:58.340
Your prints are on the floor.
walls. everything.

364
00:36:58.507 --> 00:37:01.509
Yeah. but what's my motive?
I don't have a motive. Teddy.

365
00:37:01.677 --> 00:37:06.014
Why would I do that?
Maybe one of his ex-patients came.

366
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.850
Has anybody checked the files?
Has anybody escaped?

367
00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:12.520
That person would have a motive.
I was there. and I would scream.

368
00:37:12.688 --> 00:37:15.815
-Maybe I went into shock.
-Miranda.

369
00:37:15.983 --> 00:37:18.985
The only shot we have
is to plead temporary insanity.

370
00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:23.865
I don't even know if that's gonna work.
You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

371
00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:27.369
That will make jurors think
"If she wanted to kill somebody...

372
00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:31.039
...she could probably fake insanity
and get away with it."

373
00:37:31.207 --> 00:37:32.540
I'm not crazy.

374
00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:35.043
-That's the point.
-No. the point is...

375
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:40.048
...I'm the only one around here
that believes I didn't kill my husband!

376
00:37:46.222 --> 00:37:48.348
Do you think I'm crazy?

377
00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:54.145
That's all right. Forget it.

378
00:37:54.313 --> 00:37:56.564
Forget it.

379
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.242
Sheriff Ryan is here.

380
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.452
He'd like to talk to you.

381
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.582
You know he was Doug's best friend.
so I'd advise against it.

382
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:20.213
It's fine. Teddy.
I don't have anything to hide.

383
00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:41.276
Five minutes.

384
00:38:46.073 --> 00:38:47.532
Hi. Bob.

385
00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:50.535
Miranda.

386
00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:57.125
I just have a few questions
that we need to clear up.

387
00:38:57.668 --> 00:39:02.005
When you first came in
and he was sitting on the couch...

388
00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:04.257
...the way we reconstruct the crime...

389
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:07.886
...is the first blow came
from in front of him.

390
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:11.598
Which means he must have
seen it coming.

391
00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:15.643
And what we don't understand is
how he....

392
00:39:17.229 --> 00:39:18.897
-Why did you do it?
-Sheriff.

393
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:21.691
How could you kill Doug like that?
He loved you.

394
00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:26.863
-That's the question I need answered.
-You don't have to answer.

395
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.908
I don't have any answers
to the questions. Bob.

396
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.118
You don't?
You better start thinking...

397
00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:34.746
...of some answers.
because you're in some trouble.

398
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:37.624
-Sheriff. that's enough. That's enough!
-No. no. no.

399
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:40.210
I need her to tell me why she did it.

400
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.587
Okay. we're done. Enough!

401
00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:44.923
Let's kill your friend. see how you feel!

402
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:48.593
-You said no shock treatment.
-Here's some shock treatment!

403
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.846
-Stop it. Why would you take these out?
-Don't look.

404
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:53.306
Don't look at them.

405
00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:57.769
I had to pick him up
off the floor. Miranda. In pieces!

406
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.904
Miranda. what's that?

407
00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.725
It's okay. It's okay. Miranda.

408
00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:41.604
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Miranda. let's just go. We're done.

409
00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:47.193
-Why are you doing this to me?
-It's okay.

410
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:52.657
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?!

411
00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.494
Come in. Miranda.

412
00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:05.957
Please. take a seat.

413
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:13.840
So....

414
00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:16.384
You wanted to see me.

415
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:21.306
I was there.

416
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.936
I was there when Doug was killed.

417
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:33.067
But I wasn't alone.

418
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.654
I wasn't there alone.
and that's what "not alone" means.

419
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:39.824
-Who was there with you?
-I don't know who it was.

420
00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:42.869
I don't know. I don't know who it was.

421
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.912
But somebody else was there.

422
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:50.084
Miranda.

423
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.504
We know you have no family left.

424
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.132
We are your family now.

425
00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.011
I know. I know you....
I know.

426
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:05.600
I want you to know that we're gonna
do everything we possibly can...

427
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:09.562
...to help you
and to make you feel secure.

428
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.567
And to make you feel
that you can trust us here.

429
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:19.572
But there's a hearing scheduled.

430
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.867
-Miranda. Sit down.
-Just-- Come on. sit down.

431
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.620
Miranda.

432
00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:41.094
Who is this girl?

433
00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:44.055
-Put the picture back.
-Who is this girl?

434
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.974
That's my daughter. Rachel.

435
00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:53.356
No. this is the girl I saw at the bridge.
This is the girl.

436
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.566
-No.
-How is she? Where is she?

437
00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:58.820
-It's impossible.
-This is the girl I've been seeing.

438
00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:00.947
This girl. right here.

439
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.700
She's dead.

440
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:09.455
Rachel died four years ago.

441
00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:20.234
I'm a rational person.

442
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.362
I believe in science.

443
00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:27.575
I don't believe in the paranormal.

444
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:32.830
And I don't believe in ghosts.

445
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:41.255
But if you are the ghost
of Rachel Parsons...

446
00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:45.718
...then you would let me out of this cell.

447
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.458
Bob. you leave this?

448
00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:18.352
Shit. Pete's office.

449
00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:14.700
Chloe.

450
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.508
Chloe!

451
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.146
Help me!

452
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:32.611
Let me go! Let me go!

453
00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:36.240
Check Chloe! Check Chloe!
She needs help!

454
00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.931
-Did you talk to Chloe?
-Yes.

455
00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:05.311
-Was she raped?
-Was she raped? No.

456
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:08.314
-Why?
-Did you check her?

457
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:11.776
Did I--? She was checked.
Of course she was checked.

458
00:51:11.943 --> 00:51:14.361
-He didn't have time.
-He?

459
00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:19.658
-What about her face? She had a cut.
-Ran into a wall. She did that to herself.

460
00:51:21.536 --> 00:51:25.122
I saw a tattoo.
Did she talk about a tattoo?

461
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.459
-Why don't you sit down. A tattoo?
-Yeah. a tattoo.

462
00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:33.923
A woman in flames. hands up like this:

463
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:36.092
Like a Biblical image.

464
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.552
The Anima Sola?

465
00:51:40.055 --> 00:51:44.892
-The Anima Sola. That's what I saw.
-It's a common archetypal image.

466
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.812
I mean. it's the woman in chains.
awaiting her fate.

467
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:53.067
I'm talking about something I saw
on the chest of a man.

468
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:56.403
-That's what I saw.
-You're in crisis.

469
00:51:56.571 --> 00:51:59.323
This image is tailor-made
for your state of mind.

470
00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:02.910
A woman in purgatory.

471
00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:07.748
I need you to explain this
to me. though.

472
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:16.423
-Rachel did not commit suicide.
-She jumped off a bridge.

473
00:52:16.591 --> 00:52:19.760
-When I saw her--
-She was washed downstream 5 miles.

474
00:52:19.928 --> 00:52:22.471
-She was cut up.
-You saw her?

475
00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:27.017
-I saw her. Someone did that to her!
-Police. newspapers. coroner wrong?

476
00:52:27.185 --> 00:52:29.436
-Let's reopen the case.
-Maybe they should!

477
00:52:29.604 --> 00:52:33.149
-I saw her. And she's connected to me.
-Delusions. hallucinations...

478
00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.360
-How. I don't know.
-...disorganized speech. incoherence--

479
00:52:36.528 --> 00:52:41.615
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit!
I know it like the back of my hand!

480
00:52:41.783 --> 00:52:43.450
Good.

481
00:52:43.618 --> 00:52:45.786
Saves me the trouble.

482
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.331
Glass cells
are having electrical problems.

483
00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:52.001
I'm gonna transfer you
to a Psych Ward cell.

484
00:52:52.294 --> 00:52:55.337
One strike. you're going to solitary.

485
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:57.756
Don't screw up.

486
00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:02.595
Rachel Parsons was there.

487
00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:05.848
Dead or alive. I don't know.

488
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.728
That girl came to me.

489
00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:14.690
She came to me.

490
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.191
Hi. Chloe.

491
00:54:00.695 --> 00:54:12.039
I'm sorry.

492
00:54:12.707 --> 00:54:15.334
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

493
00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:20.047
I need you to tell me
who did this to you.

494
00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:23.592
Tell me his name. Chloe.

495
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.263
Chloe. tell me.
Tell me anything. Tell me.

496
00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:30.599
I'll tell you one thing:

497
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:33.435
He can have my body...

498
00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:36.814
...but he will never have my soul.

499
00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:38.315
Never.

500
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:42.903
The devil.

501
00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:14.643
It's okay.

502
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:18.772
He said you're next.

503
00:55:33.788 --> 00:55:37.166
-Try to stay awake.
-Yes. ma'am.

504
00:55:37.417 --> 00:55:41.295
If you need me.
I'll be in the coffee room.

505
00:55:54.434 --> 00:55:56.560
Lights out.

506
00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.734
Leave me alone!

507
00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:37.870
-Doesn't even look like a real ant.
-It's got disco balls for eyes.

508
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:40.956
-'50s B movies. man.
-Giant bug movies are great.

509
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.000
Hey. what is that?

510
00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:52.593
It's Dr. Grey.
She's trying to kill herself.

511
00:57:53.928 --> 00:57:57.306
Level C. we've got suicidal behaviour
in cell 33. Sending backup.

512
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.022
Open it!

513
00:58:08.234 --> 00:58:10.652
Dr. Grey's in trouble!

514
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.409
Number 33. open it now!

515
00:58:21.206 --> 00:58:24.458
Oh. damn.
Damn. what a mess.

516
00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:28.253
-Hold her. I'll medicate her.
-What the hell for? She's already out.

517
00:58:28.421 --> 00:58:30.797
Don't argue with me.

518
00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:34.426
Jesus! Easy. easy.
No. don't hurt me.

519
00:58:35.303 --> 00:58:37.930
Stop her! She's got my keys. stop her!

520
00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:39.723
Shit!

521
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:50.317
Hey! Hey!

522
00:58:50.485 --> 00:58:51.735
Wait! Hey!

523
00:58:51.903 --> 00:58:54.780
We got a runner! Inmate escaping!
Block Three!

524
00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:04.665
-Stay with me.
-All right.

525
00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:09.044
She's gone this way. Let's go!

526
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.965
Clear!

527
00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:29.565
Split up! Keep moving!

528
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:38.031
She's going up the North Tower!

529
00:59:52.338 --> 01:00:16.153
Shit!

530
01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.450
Hey! It's already open!

531
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.375
She's on the upper level!

532
01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:33.795
Hold it right there!

533
01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.840
-Dr. Grey!
-We're on Three. she's heading for One!

534
01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:40.177
Go! Go!

535
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.432
Go the other way!

536
01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:58.278
Circle back.

537
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.516
Come on. Hank.

538
01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.523
Don't think she made it
to this building anyway.

539
01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.738
Yeah. but even so.
there's no way she can get out.

540
01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:45.283
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts.
the more overtime we make.

541
01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:21.862
-You should be a professor.
-Professors nail the pretty students.

542
01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:32.456
Let's go. I don't think she's in here.

543
01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:47.888
I got it.

544
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.224
Is it clear there?

545
01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:57.397
We checked corridors Four and Five.

546
01:02:57.565 --> 01:03:01.735
-We're headed to Six and Seven.
-Yeah. It's Joe. up at the desk.

547
01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:04.905
-What's going on down there?
-Looks dark down there.

548
01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:07.157
What do you mean. what do I mean?

549
01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:11.453
Look. this is the fourth time this month
this has happened. Never mind.

550
01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.165
-Ye-- Thank you.
-Finally.

551
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.209
-Took long enough.
-Shit.

552
01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.753
Hey. Joe.

553
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.757
You see something?

554
01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:26.927
Yeah. just now
when the monitors came on.

555
01:03:27.094 --> 01:03:30.806
Corridor Six. something flashed
in front of the camera.

556
01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.184
Frank. East Wing. Don. take the West.
I'll take the stairs.

557
01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:40.774
Here. take my car.

558
01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.526
Go. Go.

559
01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:45.070
Go on.

560
01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:18.496
What do you want from me?!

561
01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:18.807
Okay. Now what?

562
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.028
Miranda. no!

563
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.994
Doug?

564
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:26.684
No. No. Miranda. no.

565
01:08:29.396 --> 01:08:32.398
Miranda. don't! No. don't. please!

566
01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:35.360
Please! No! Miranda. no!
No. please!

567
01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:39.447
Please! Don't do this to me! No!

568
01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.117
Don't! No! Miranda. no. wait!

569
01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:44.285
Don't do this to me. please. Miranda!

570
01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.122
Miranda. no! Don't! No!

571
01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:51.167
Don't do this to me. Miranda!
Miranda. please!

572
01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.044
I love you.

573
01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:54.838
What did I do?

574
01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:52.830
Why?

575
01:10:57.544 --> 01:10:59.504
Why me?

576
01:11:02.299 --> 01:11:05.093
Why? Why?

577
01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.025
Willow Creek.

578
01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:22.443
How was Willow Creek?

579
01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:26.364
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big damn mess.

580
01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.610
I'll see you in a couple of days.

581
01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.456
It's good to be God.

582
01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:10.708
I love you.

583
01:17:36.276 --> 01:17:37.943
-Drop the knife!
-Drop the gun!

584
01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:39.487
Put it on the ground now!

585
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.280
-Drop the gun!
-Drop the knife!

586
01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.949
-You drop it!
-Holy Christ.

587
01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:45.618
What?

588
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.124
Help me. please!

589
01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:54.085
Help!

590
01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:56.504
Carter. get down here now!

591
01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.547
Help me. please!

592
01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:00.633
Please!

593
01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:05.638
All I can tell you is that the girl
has been identified as Tracy Seavers.

594
01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:08.099
She was reported missing
two weeks ago.

595
01:18:08.266 --> 01:18:11.519
She was found this morning
by two patrolmen in Willow Creek...

596
01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:15.398
...at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas
Grey. She is now hospitalised.

597
01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.692
Can she speak?
Has she told you anything?

598
01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:20.277
-We can't comment on that.
-Are there others?

599
01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:22.196
We can't confirm that. Excuse me.

600
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.157
Sheriff. is the FBI taking over
this investigation?

601
01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:27.159
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI?

602
01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:29.537
We need her at the hospital
for medication.

603
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.957
Consider house arrest pending trial.
given the circumstances.

604
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:35.751
Last night.
your client dropped a guard...

605
01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:39.255
...assaulted a nurse. escaped from
an institution. stole a car--

606
01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.507
And saved a girl's life.

607
01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:44.427
-How did she know she was there?
-I don't know.

608
01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:48.431
-But the point is--
-The woman is still a murder suspect!

609
01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.349
Come here.

610
01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.940
The FBI says there could be
more victims.

611
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.776
There were needles down there.
a video camera.

612
01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:03.946
Once the press gets ahold of it.
it'll get big and ugly.

613
01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.199
Now. I need some answers.
and I'm running out of time.

614
01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:10.703
So your client isn't going anywhere
until my team....

615
01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:20.504
I need to talk to her.

616
01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:35.603
It's hard to believe
Doug did something like this.

617
01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:40.483
We worked together a long time.
I thought I knew him pretty well.

618
01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:46.822
How could I be so blind?

619
01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:52.661
Well. you weren't the only one. Phil.

620
01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:00.544
Do you think my daughter could
also have been a victim of Doug's?

621
01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:02.880
Yes.

622
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.883
That's what "not alone" means.

623
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:11.013
Rachel was trying to tell me that
she was not Doug's only victim.

624
01:20:12.265 --> 01:20:14.475
And all this time...

625
01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:19.939
...we thought our baby
had committed suicide.

626
01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.817
You see...

627
01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.444
...even after she was gone....

628
01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:29.698
Well....

629
01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.452
What?

630
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.955
I had this recurring dream about her.

631
01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:39.625
Eventually I took medication
to block it out.

632
01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:41.252
What kind of dream?

633
01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:45.965
She was burning in flames.
in terrible pain.

634
01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.467
I couldn't save her.

635
01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:53.514
I saw her exactly the same way.
burning in flames.

636
01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.683
What does that mean?

637
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.812
Miranda. I-- I....

638
01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.148
I wouldn't look for
a real-world explanation.

639
01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:07.069
It's a dream. a delusion.

640
01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:10.823
A delusion that we both seem to share.

641
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.585
-Yeah.
-Pete.

642
01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.378
I was just talking to Parsons.

643
01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.797
I've been wrong about
everything until now.

644
01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:29.925
It's finally clear to me.
The image is finally clear.

645
01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:33.220
The man raping women in prison
is connected to the murders.

646
01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.389
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo.

647
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.809
Miranda. you have to stop doing this.
Do you understand me?

648
01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:43.647
Every time people start taking you
seriously. you talk about delusions.

649
01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.400
I'm not deluded. Pete. I'm possessed.

650
01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:49.862
I don't believe in ghosts.

651
01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:53.532
Neither do I. but they believe in me.

652
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.993
Great. just great.

653
01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.883
Let's go. Come on.

654
01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:19.058
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan.

655
01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:22.186
He's working with the FBI team.
He won't be back tonight.

656
01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.396
It's really important.

657
01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:26.523
I'll leave him a message.

658
01:22:28.568 --> 01:22:30.110
Thank you.

659
01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.755
Screw it.

660
01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.960
I got a message
you wanted to talk to me?

661
01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:31.213
Yeah. Bob.

662
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:35.300
I wanna talk to you. Maybe this time
you can actually hear me.

663
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:40.014
The last time. all you wanted to do was
scream and yell and accuse me--

664
01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:44.518
-Is this what you wanna talk about?
-No. I wanna talk about the facts.

665
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.812
They're a little different now. right?

666
01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:50.941
Do you know what happens
to a small-town sheriff...

667
01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:53.110
...when the FBI takes over?

668
01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:56.488
-If you know anything. anything--
-Not alone.

669
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.240
What?

670
01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.034
Not alone.

671
01:24:00.326 --> 01:24:02.453
I know what it means.

672
01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.289
There are two killers.

673
01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:09.543
Parsons and I both saw a girl
burning in flames.

674
01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:14.256
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man
with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body.

675
01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:18.343
A woman burning in flames. Get it?

676
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.015
Okay. it's crazy. I know it sounds
crazy. Pete has told me it's crazy.

677
01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.809
-You told Pete? When?
-Yes.

678
01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.519
Yes.

679
01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:30.189
This afternoon. Why?

680
01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:36.820
I don't think you're crazy at all.
I don't know why he would dismiss it.

681
01:24:36.988 --> 01:24:41.784
-You actually saw this tattoo?
-Yes. I saw it. On a man.

682
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:44.411
I've heard of serial killers
who hunt together.

683
01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.622
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome.

684
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:50.042
So we're looking for the disciple?
Who could it be?

685
01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:52.419
-I don't know.
-You're a psychiatrist.

686
01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.880
What kind of guy
would this have to be?

687
01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.341
Okay.

688
01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:03.806
He would have to be someone
who grew up in a household...

689
01:25:03.973 --> 01:25:06.183
...that had an absent father.

690
01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:08.435
He developed...

691
01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:11.897
...an obsessive. over-dependent
relationship with his mother...

692
01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:16.068
...which then turned into some
inappropriate sexual attraction.

693
01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:20.781
He probably even got off
torturing little animals as a kid.

694
01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:27.246
And as a man he is totally confused
about his sexuality.

695
01:25:27.413 --> 01:25:29.414
That's who he is.

696
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:34.169
Man. that's screwed up.

697
01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:38.674
But a guy like that could seem
smart and normal. right?

698
01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.676
Yeah. they usually do. Yeah.

699
01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:43.428
Look. Miranda.
I don't wanna scare you...

700
01:25:43.888 --> 01:25:46.473
...but if there is a second killer
out there...

701
01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:49.434
...he is frantically trying
to cover his trail.

702
01:25:49.602 --> 01:25:53.063
You're a big threat to this guy.
Who knows how much more you know?

703
01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:54.690
I don't know anything else.

704
01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:57.484
You saw the tattoo.
found the girl at the barn.

705
01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.736
Yeah. but I found all that by instinct.

706
01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:02.447
This guy is facing the electric chair.

707
01:26:02.907 --> 01:26:06.118
He doesn't have the luxury
of believing in instinct or ghosts.

708
01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:10.122
He's gotta believe that Doug
confessed to you what he was doing.

709
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.749
But he didn't confess.

710
01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:15.794
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud. but....

711
01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:19.923
Well. you know. you're a psychiatrist.

712
01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.843
There's a lot of ways to confess.

713
01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:27.764
I'm just trying to put myself
in this guy's place.

714
01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:33.979
Then why didn't he go back
to Willow Creek?

715
01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.066
-Take care of the girl. clean up?
-Yeah.

716
01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:41.820
Well. that's how you get caught.
You panic.

717
01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:45.449
Better to let the dust settle.

718
01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.202
But about you...

719
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.913
-...he's desperate.
-Yeah?

720
01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:53.498
Desperate enough to...

721
01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.375
...talk to me?

722
01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:01.381
Well. you're right.

723
01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.842
I do fit the profile.

724
01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:07.888
Long-time friend of Doug's.
access to the prison.

725
01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:12.476
I never did get a kick out of
torturing animals. though.

726
01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:17.606
Stop it!

727
01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:20.734
-No!
-Yes!

728
01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.073
-You can't kill me!
-I'm not gonna kill you.

729
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:30.535
After this kicks in. I'm gonna have a lot
more fun with you than Doug ever did.

730
01:27:30.703 --> 01:27:32.204
Help!

731
01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.425
Miranda!

732
01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:50.722
Damn it!

733
01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:54.393
Help me! Help!

734
01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.939
Help me!

735
01:28:23.923 --> 01:28:25.882
Okay.

736
01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:30.762
You tried to escape. Miranda.

737
01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:36.560
That means I can do
whatever I want to you.

738
01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:43.150
Rachel wasn't the first. you know.

739
01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:48.405
Doug killed a girl when he was
15 years old!

740
01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:52.451
I helped him bury the body.

741
01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.249
What are best friends for?

742
01:29:02.295 --> 01:29:04.796
We got older. But I gotta tell you...

743
01:29:04.964 --> 01:29:08.216
...you never lose your taste
for the young girls.

744
01:29:08.634 --> 01:29:11.845
Then we stopped for a long time.

745
01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:15.640
But then Dougie
saw sweet Rachel and....

746
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.896
That was an itch way too deep
not to scratch.

747
01:29:22.815 --> 01:29:26.860
And then we had the time of our lives
out at Willow Creek.

748
01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:29.738
Everything was perfect.

749
01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:32.616
Those girls would do anything.

750
01:29:32.825 --> 01:29:34.701
We were their god.

751
01:29:35.411 --> 01:29:37.287
Until you--

752
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:40.582
Miranda!

753
01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:49.883
You and I both know
you're not getting out of here.

754
01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.344
So let's be logical...

755
01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:55.180
...and end this thing.

756
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.359
Thank you. Miranda.

757
01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.370
Rachel?

758
01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:25.293
This isn't logical.

759
01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:27.379
You're already dead!

760
01:30:53.739 --> 01:30:56.241
Logic is overrated.

761
01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:39.451
I'm sorry. Miranda.

762
01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:56.343
So it's been almost a year
and I still have bad dreams.

763
01:31:56.969 --> 01:31:59.387
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

764
01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:01.181
That's normal.

765
01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.975
No. not these dreams.

766
01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:07.646
Everyone thought
you and I were crazy...

767
01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.898
...but we were seeing the truth.

768
01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.067
More than they could see.

769
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:16.279
Once you open the door.
you can never close it.

770
01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:19.157
Not true. I closed it.

771
01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.159
Then I locked it...

772
01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:23.119
...and then I threw away the key.

773
01:32:23.287 --> 01:32:25.705
I really hope that's true.

774
01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:29.459
You know. my train leaves
in half an hour.

775
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.587
Okay. I'll get you on your way.

776
01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:39.636
So good luck with your job. okay?

777
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.766
I wanted to thank you for what you did.

778
01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:47.978
You really helped me.

779
01:32:48.145 --> 01:32:50.146
You helped me.

780
01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:52.649
You taught me how to listen.

781
01:32:53.025 --> 01:32:54.609
Thank you.

782
01:32:56.362 --> 01:32:58.196
We made it.

783
01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:50.957
No!
